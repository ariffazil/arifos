# arifOS - Sovereign Constitutional Intelligence Kernel

> DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI - Intelligence is forged, not given.

arifOS is the law kernel for a governed AI federation. It is not a model, chatbot, or agent persona. It is the constitutional runtime that decides how AI systems observe, reason, execute, judge, and seal actions through MCP tools, typed schemas, floor enforcement, and VAULT999 audit trails.

The core guarantee is simple: high-impact or irreversible action must pass constitutional judgment before execution, and the human sovereign retains final veto.

## What arifOS Does

arifOS governs AI work through five responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Constitutional law | Defines the 13 floors that constrain action. |
| Runtime governance | Registers MCP tools, prompts, resources, schemas, and HTTP routes. |
| Judgment | Emits `SEAL`, `HOLD`, or `VOID` decisions for proposed action. |
| Execution gating | Routes irreversible work through identity, risk, and floor checks. |
| Witness and memory | Preserves evidence, state, and audit trails through VAULT999 and supporting stores. |

arifOS may be used alone as an MCP server, or as the law kernel in the wider federation:

| Project | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `arifOS` | Constitutional law kernel and VAULT999 authority. |
| `A-FORGE` | Execution shell and agent orchestration layer. |
| `GEOX` | Earth-domain coprocessor for geoscience and physical evidence. |
| `WEALTH` | Capital intelligence coprocessor for valuation and risk. |
| `compose` | Production stack wiring Caddy, Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, Ollama, arifOS, GEOX, WEALTH, and gateway services. |

A-FORGE may orchestrate. arifOS adjudicates. Domain coprocessors provide evidence and specialist computation, but constitutional verdicts belong here.

## Runtime Surface

The current runtime registers **13 MCP tools**. These are pure capability tools.

### Constitutional Tools

| Stage | Tool | Lane | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `000` | `arif_session_init` | AGI | public | Start a session and bind identity context. |
| `111` | `arif_sense_observe` | AGI | public | Observe reality, telemetry, and evidence. |
| `222` | `arif_evidence_fetch` | AGI | public | Fetch and preserve evidence. |
| `333` | `arif_mind_reason` | AGI | public | Reason with humility, claim labeling, and synthesis traces. |
| `444` | `arif_kernel_route` | AGI | public | Route kernel actions and telemetry. |
| `444r` | `arif_reply_compose` | AGI | public | Compose governed responses. |
| `555` | `arif_memory_recall` | AGI | public | Recall, store, search, and prune governed memory context. |
| `666` | `arif_heart_critique` | ASI | authenticated | Critique safety, empathy, consequence, and manipulation risk. |
| `666g` | `arif_gateway_connect` | ASI | authenticated | Connect and route across A2A/federated gateways. |
| `777` | `arif_ops_measure` | AGI | public | Measure operations, cost, vitality, and thermodynamics. |
| `888` | `arif_judge_deliberate` | ASI | authenticated | Produce constitutional verdicts. |
| `999` | `arif_vault_seal` | APEX | authenticated | Seal audit records and ledger entries. |
| `010` | `arif_forge_execute` | AGI | sovereign | Dispatch execution to A-FORGE with irreversible-action controls. |

Access classes:

| Access | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| public | `arif_session_init`, `arif_sense_observe`, `arif_mind_reason`, `arif_kernel_route`, `arif_ops_measure`, `arif_memory_recall`, `arif_evidence_fetch`, `arif_reply_compose` |
| authenticated | `arif_heart_critique`, `arif_judge_deliberate`, `arif_vault_seal`, `arif_gateway_connect` |
| sovereign | `arif_forge_execute` |

## Internal Disciplines

Unlike capability tools, the following are internal runtime disciplines and are not exposed as public MCP tools:

| Discipline | Purpose | Internal Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ping** | Lightweight health and version probe. | `_runtime_ping()` |
| **Selftest** | Deep integrity and registry verification. | `_runtime_selftest()` |
| **Context Witness** | Governed internal interpretation sidecar. | `_context_witness()` |

## The Context Witness

arifOS implements a **Context Witness** sidecar that injects a linguistic-ethical layer into tool outputs. 

- **Doctrine**: Interpretation, not generation.
- **Mechanism**: Retrieves approved witnesses from a locked 99-quote ledger.
- **Safety**: Fail-closed on quote drift, author drift, or unauthorized IDs.
- **Boundary**: Forces `human_decision_required` for high-risk or irreversible contexts.

## 13 Constitutional Floors

| Floor | Name | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `F01` | AMANAH | Actions must be accountable; irreversible action requires approval and trace. |
| `F02` | TRUTH | Do not fabricate. Separate fact, estimate, hypothesis, and unknown. |
| `F03` | WITNESS | Evidence must be inspectable and preserved where possible. |
| `F04` | CLARITY | Intent, uncertainty, and consequences must be legible. |
| `F05` | PEACE | Preserve dignity and reduce avoidable harm. |
| `F06` | EMPATHY | Model stakeholder consequences before acting. |
| `F07` | HUMILITY | Bound confidence and acknowledge limits. |
| `F08` | GENIUS | Prefer elegant correctness over noisy complexity. |
| `F09` | ANTIHANTU | Reject manipulation, dark patterns, and false agency claims. |
| `F10` | ONTOLOGY | Preserve structural and identity coherence. |
| `F11` | AUTH | Verify actor authority before sensitive operations. |
| `F12` | INJECTION | Treat inputs as hostile until sanitized. |
| `F13` | SOVEREIGN | Human veto is absolute. |

## Verdicts

arifOS judgment collapses proposed action into one of three operational states:

| Verdict | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SEAL` | Proceed; action is constitutionally cleared and may be recorded. |
| `HOLD` | Pause; more evidence, identity, consent, or review is required. |
| `VOID` | Halt; action violates a hard floor or cannot be safely justified. |

The expected path for high-impact action is:

```text
observe -> reason -> critique -> judge -> execute or hold -> seal
```

## HTTP Endpoints

Operational diagnostics are exposed through REST routes:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/mcp` | MCP streamable HTTP endpoint. |
| `/health` | Lightweight liveness probe and registry count. |
| `/ready` | Deep integrity probe (Runtime selftest summary). |
| `/humans.txt` | Human attribution. |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /root/arifOS

python -m pip install -e . --break-system-packages
arifos-mcp
```

Alternative entrypoints:

```bash
python -m arifosmcp.server
uvicorn arifosmcp.runtime.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Probe the server:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:8080/ready | jq .
```

## Docker

```bash
cd /root/arifOS
docker build -t arifos:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 arifos:local
```

Production compose expects the shared `arifos_core_network` Docker network and supporting services.

```bash
cd /root/arifOS
docker compose up -d --build arifosmcp
docker compose logs -f arifosmcp
```

## Development

Run focused checks:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
ruff check .
mypy arifosmcp/
```

Useful Makefile targets:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make status` | Run reforge/status and show git status. |
| `make forge` | Run reforge and stage changes. |
| `make seal` | Commit and push a dated seal commit. |

## Security Rules for Agents

Agents working in this repository must follow these hard rules:

1. Do not fabricate runtime facts. Verify with code, tests, or live endpoints.
2. Do not expose secrets, tokens, `.env` files, private keys, or raw credential values.
3. Do not run destructive operations without explicit human approval.
4. Treat VAULT999 ledgers as append-only.
5. Keep constitutional judgment in arifOS.
6. If docs, registry, and runtime disagree, report the conflict and cite the stronger SOT.
