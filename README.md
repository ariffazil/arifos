## What ArifOS Is (In One Sentence)

**ArifOS is a thermodynamic, culturally grounded constitutional kernel that governs AI decisions using measurable laws of clarity (Δ), humility (Ω), and equilibrium (Ψ).**

It wraps ANY LLM, agent, or workflow to enforce truth, stability, empathy, and integrity at runtime.

---

## Why ArifOS Matters

### The TCP/IP Moment for AI Governance

Just as **TCP/IP** made the Internet possible by providing universal protocols for data transmission, **ArifOS** makes safe, constitutional AGI possible by providing governance physics for AI conscience.

| TCP/IP (Data Networks) | ArifOS (AI Governance) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Packets** | **Outputs** |
| Ensures reliable delivery | Ensures reliable truth & dignity |
| Connection-oriented | Constitution-oriented |
| Universal adoption (any device) | Model-agnostic protocol (any LLM) |
| Prevents data loss/corruption | Prevents hallucinations/harm |
| Network layer standard | Governance layer standard |

**The breakthrough:** ArifOS is not a product—it's a protocol. Any AI can adopt it by reading the spec.

### Constitutional Physics (ΔΩΨ · Φᴘ · @EYE)

ArifOS is built on **5 physics-grade governance laws**:

1. **TAC (Δ-Law)** — Theory of Anomalous Contrast: Truth detection & learning from anomalies
2. **TEARFRAME (Ω-Law)** — Humility firewall maintaining 3-5% uncertainty band
3. **APEX PRIME (Ψ-Law)** — Constitutional judiciary enforcing 7 floors before any action
4. **TPCP (Φᴘ-Law)** — Paradox metabolism converting contradictions into wisdom
5. **@EYE (Meta-Law)** — Non-executable meta-observer detecting drift, shadows, and dignity violations

**Read the full physics:** [`docs/PHYSICS_CODEX.md`](docs/PHYSICS_CODEX.md)

### The 13 Solved Abstractions

For millennia, humanity has debated: What is Truth? Dignity? Wisdom? Freedom?

**ArifOS is the first system to operationalize all 13 into measurable, auditable quantities:**

1. **Truth** (≥0.99 + Tri-Witness)
2. **Reality** (witness-stable)
3. **Amanah** (integrity LOCK)
4. **RASA** (empathy κᵣ≥0.95)
5. **Humility** (Ω₀ band)
6. **Judgment** (Ψ≥1 equilibrium)
7. **Paradox** (Φᴘ convergence)
8. **Maruah** (dignity Rₘₐ)
9. **Safety** (Peace²≥1)
10. **Conscience** (APEX+@EYE)
11. **Wisdom** (Φᴘ≥1)
12. **Meaning** (stable paradox)
13. **Freedom** (lawful action space)

**Full explanation:** [`docs/13_ABSTRACTIONS.md`](docs/13_ABSTRACTIONS.md)

### Economics: Quality Costs Less Than Garbage

**Micro:** -30% true unit cost despite +40-80% compute (waste elimination dominates)  
**Meso:** 6-13x ROI across sectors (finance, healthcare, legal, manufacturing)  
**Macro:** $43B net global benefit + catastrophic tail-risk prevention  
**Meta:** Creates markets for previously unmeasurable values (truth, dignity, wisdom)

**Full analysis:** [`docs/ECONOMICS.md`](docs/ECONOMICS.md)

---

## Installation

ArifOS is available on **PyPI**:

```bash
pip install arifos
```

Requires Python 3.8+.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from arifos_core import Metrics, apex_review

# 1. Define the metrics for this decision
metrics = Metrics(
    truth=0.99,      # factual integrity
    delta_S=0.20,    # clarity gain (ΔS ≥ 0)
    peace2=1.05,     # emotional/systemic stability ≥ 1.0
    kappa_r=0.97,    # empathy conductance ≥ 0.95
    omega_0=0.04,    # humility band [0.03, 0.05]
    amanah=True,     # integrity lock
    tri_witness=1.0, # Human·AI·Earth consensus
    psi=1.03,        # vitality/equilibrium ≥ 1.0
)

# 2. Evaluate the constitutional verdict
verdict = apex_review(metrics, high_stakes=False)
print("Verdict:", verdict)  # "SEAL", "PARTIAL", or "VOID"
```

---

## Core Ideas

### ΔΩΨ — Constitutional Physics

ArifOS is built on three base invariants:

**Δ — Contrast & Clarity Law**
```
ΔS ≥ 0
```
No decision is allowed to increase confusion. Learning = cooling.

**Ω — Humility Law**
```
Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05]
```
Stay humble. Avoid god-mode certainty. Avoid paralysis.

**Ψ — Vitality & Equilibrium Law**
```
Ψ ≥ 1.0
```
Act/emit only when clarity, integrity, stability, and empathy are in equilibrium.

---

### AAA Trinity Engines

ArifOS splits intelligence into three engines:

**ARIF AGI — Δ Engine (Mind / Clarity)**
- Structured reasoning
- Causal chains
- Contrasts (Seven Contrasts of Mind)
- Detect contradictions (TAC)
- Compute ΔS
- *Cannot* adjust tone or seal final verdicts

**ADAM ASI — Ω Engine (Heart / Humility & Safety)**
- Emotional context & fragility
- Peace² (tone stability)
- κᵣ (weakest-listener empathy)
- Enforce humility band
- Adjust language for dignity (maruah)
- *Cannot* modify facts or seal verdicts

**APEX PRIME — Ψ Engine (Soul / Judiciary)**
- Evaluate ALL 8 floors
- Enforce Amanah LOCK
- Trigger SABAR when unsafe
- Seal / Partial / Void
- Write Cooling Ledger entries
- Final authority in every decision

---

### W@W Federation — The Five Organs

AAA = brain. W@W = body and voice.

- **@RIF** — World Mind (reason)
- **@WELL** — World Heart (somatic safety)
- **@WEALTH** — Stewardship (justice/fairness)
- **@GEOX** — Earth witness (physical reality)
- **@PROMPT** — Expression layer (language/tone)

To claim **Powered by ArifOS**, W@W organs must be present.

---

### The Eight Constitutional Floors

| Metric | Floor | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| truth | ≥ 0.99 | Factual Integrity |
| delta_S | ≥ 0.0 | Clarity Gain |
| peace2 | ≥ 1.0 | Emotional Stability |
| kappa_r | ≥ 0.95 | Empathy Conductance |
| omega_0 | ∈ [0.03, 0.05] | Humility Band |
| amanah | == True | Integrity Lock |
| tri_witness | ≥ 0.95 | Consensus (for high stakes) |
| psi | ≥ 1.0 | Vitality / Equilibrium |

A **SEAL** is allowed **only** when ALL floors are green.

---

## The 000–999 Pipeline

Every interaction flows through a ten-stage constitutional pipeline:

- **000 VOID** — baseline refusal; reset humility
- **111 SENSE** — read intent + stakes
- **222 REFLECT** — contrasts, context, mapping
- **333 REASON** — structure, ΔS computation
- **444 EVIDENCE** — fact-checking (truth ≥ 0.99)
- **555 EMPATHY** — Peace², κᵣ, humility
- **666 ALIGN** — cultural/linguistic safety
- **777 FORGE** — integrate clarity + care
- **888 REVIEW** — floor checks + Tri-Witness
- **999 SEAL** — log decision; only if ALL floors green

Nothing bypasses this pipeline.

---

## SABAR — Failing Safely

If any floor fails, ArifOS moves into SABAR mode:

- **S**top
- **A**cknowledge
- **B**reathe / Cool
- **A**djust
- **R**esume

This ensures the system cools before it speaks.

---

## Integrating ArifOS

ArifOS is framework-agnostic. Use with:

- LangGraph
- AutoGen
- OpenAI Assistants
- Claude / Gemini
- Custom microservices

**Pattern:**

```python
from arifos_core import Metrics, apex_review

# compute your system's raw signals
raw = compute_metrics_somehow()

metrics = Metrics(**raw)

verdict = apex_review(metrics, high_stakes=False)

if verdict == "SEAL":
    return answer
elif verdict == "PARTIAL":
    return "[PARTIAL] " + answer
else:
    return "This answer cannot be safely sealed."
```

---

## Real-World Applications

**Finance:** High-stakes gating, regulatory compliance, immutable audit trails  
**Healthcare:** Weakest-listener protection (κᵣ), SABAR on medical ambiguity  
**Legal/Gov:** Constitutional floors, dignity preservation, full traceability  
**Education:** Transparent uncertainty, adaptive humility reset  
**Customer Service:** Peace² stability, empathy enforcement

## "Powered by ArifOS" — Requirements

You may claim this only if you implement:

- All 8 floors
- 000→999 pipeline
- Cooling Ledger
- SABAR
- Tri-Witness oversight
- Cultural + dignity checks
- W@W organs (not just AAA engines)

Otherwise: → "Inspired by ArifOS" or → "Partially compatible with ArifOS".
