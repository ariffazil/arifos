# GEOX PRODUCT VERSIONING SCHEMA
**Version 1.0 — 2026-04-14**

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI — 999 SEAL ALIVE**

---

## 0. Purpose

Every GEOX canonical product is a **governed, versioned, replayable object**. This document defines the minimal schema all 12 canonical products must carry, the versioning rules, the binding to the arifOS vault (Merkle chain), and the audit replay contract.

A product without this schema **cannot be SEAL**. It may exist as a working artifact; it cannot be a governed output.

---

## 1. Core Product Schema

All 12 canonical GEOX products share this schema. Fields marked `REQUIRED` must be present for any verdict beyond VOID. Fields marked `CONDITIONAL` are required when the specified condition holds.

```

---

## 2. Product ID Convention

Product IDs must be globally unique and human-parseable:

```
{DIMENSION}-{BASIN_CODE}-{YEAR}-{MAJOR_VERSION}-{UUID4_SHORT}

Example:
  HAZARD-MALAY-2026-V1-a3f9c1
  HYDRO-SEPAT-2025-V2-88bc04
  CCS-BESAR-2026-V1-c7d221
```

- **DIMENSION**: uppercase dimension name from the registry
- **BASIN_CODE**: short code for basin or field (max 8 chars, alphanumeric)
- **YEAR**: 4-digit year of first issuance
- **MAJOR_VERSION**: V1, V2, ... (incremented on data or engine change)
- **UUID4_SHORT**: first 6 chars of a UUID4 (collision avoidance)

---

## 3. Versioning Rules

### 3.1 When to increment MAJOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

- New L0 data added that changes the physical interpretation
- Engine upgraded to a new major version
- Basin geological model structurally revised
- Prior product was VOID or HOLD that has now been resolved

### 3.2 When to increment MINOR version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

- Processing parameters tuned (grid resolution, search radius)
- Additional UQ scenarios added without new raw data
- ToAC scores revised after calibration event
- Floor flag status changed (e.g., F8 review now complete)

### 3.3 When to increment PATCH version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

- Metadata correction (CRS string, date typo, provider name)
- Transform ledger annotation added
- Anti-hantu statement appended

### 3.4 Immutability rule

Once a product has been **SEAL**-vaulted (vault_hash present), its content is immutable. Only PATCH increments are permitted on vaulted products, and only for metadata. Any content change requires a new MINOR or MAJOR version.

---

## 4. Vault Binding (Merkle Chain)

Every product that achieves SEAL verdict must be committed to the arifOS vault:

```
PRODUCT_OBJECT → SHA-256 hash → submitted to arifOS vault tool
                                ↓
                        vault issues Merkle hash
                                ↓
                        vault_hash written back to product schema
                                ↓
                        product is now tamper-evident and replayable
```

The vault commitment chain means:
- Any modification of a vaulted product is **detectable** (hash mismatch)
- Any disputes about what was asserted at time of decision can be resolved by replaying the product
- Audit trails for regulatory submissions (F8) are permanently available

---

## 5. Replayability Contract

A product with vault_hash MUST be fully replayable. This means:

1. All L0 input files are archived (or URIs are durable and access-controlled)
2. Engine configuration (config_hash) is stored alongside the product
3. The transform ledger fully documents every processing step
4. The UQ method and parameters are sufficient to re-run the uncertainty analysis
5. The ToAC scores are justifiable from the evidence in the product schema without external memory

GEOX does not guarantee physical reproducibility (engines may behave non-deterministically), but guarantees **audit reproducibility**: a reviewer with the schema can reconstruct the reasoning chain used to issue the verdict.

---

## 6. Product Lifecycle

```
DRAFT
  ↓ (L0 data loaded, engine run, UQ computed)
CANDIDATE
  ↓ (ToAC scored; AC_Risk computed; floor flags checked)
  ├── if VOID → archived with VOID status; no further steps
  ├── if HOLD → 888_HOLD gate opened; awaits human resolution
  │     ↓ (human resolves: approved / rejected / revised)
  │     └── if revised → back to CANDIDATE
  └── if SEAL or QUALIFY
        ↓ (vault committed; vault_hash issued)
SEALED
  ↓ (new data arrives or calibration event triggers)
SUPERSEDED (superseded_by = new product_id)
```

Dead states: VOID and SUPERSEDED products are retained for audit but must not be used for new decisions without explicit sovereign override.
