## 2026-05-01 — Replace plain 8-step ReAct loop with 000–999 governed loop

**Decision ID:** DEC-001
**Task ID:** OC-001 (Upgrade OPENCLAW runtime governance)
**Stage:** 333 REASON → 444 CRITIQUE
**Autonomy level:** L3

**Candidate:** Remove plain 8-step ReAct loop from AGENTS.md; replace with 000–999 constitutional loop; declare ReAct as inner micro-loop inside 666 FORGE only.
**Verdict:** SEALED
**Approved by:** Arif (888 Judge)

**Reason:** Plain ReAct loop in AGENTS.md contradicts SOUL.md governance model and creates unbounded tool-use risk. The plain loop bypasses 444 CRITIQUE, 888 JUDGE, and 999 SEAL — making tool use effectively ungoverned at the behavioral level.

**Evidence basis:** Audit of AGENTS.md sections 2, 3, and 4 confirmed three conflicting governance models (plain ReAct + F1–F13 floors + Safety Manifest) coexisting without resolution.

**Constitutional floors checked:** F02 TRUTH (no contradiction), F04 CLARITY (transparent intent), F08 GENIUS (elegant correctness), F09 ANTIHANTU (prevents unbounded execution)

**Risk:** Medium
**Irreversible:** No (can revert by editing AGENTS.md)
**Rollback possible:** Yes

**Outcome:** AGENTS.md updated. LOOP.md created. ReAct is now explicitly the inner micro-loop inside 666 FORGE only.

**Status:** SEALED

## 2026-05-01 — Create AUTONOMY.md L0–L5 permission ladder

**Decision ID:** DEC-002
**Task ID:** OC-001
**Stage:** 444 CRITIQUE
**Autonomy level:** L3

**Candidate:** Create AUTONOMY.md with L0–L5 autonomy ladder, per-task level assignment, escalation triggers, maturity gap analysis.
**Verdict:** SEALED
**Approved by:** Arif (888 Judge)

**Reason:** Audit identified no autonomy boundary defined — all tasks treated equally regardless of consequence level. Ladder provides explicit permission structure.

**Constitutional floors checked:** F01 AMANAH (accountable autonomy), F06 EMPATHY (reduces human burden), F13 SOVEREIGN (Arif sets level)

**Risk:** Low
**Irreversible:** No
**Rollback possible:** Yes

**Outcome:** AUTONOMY.md created with L0–L5 ladder and escalation matrix.

**Status:** SEALED

## 2026-05-01 — Create CHECKPOINT.md session continuity file

**Decision ID:** DEC-003
**Task ID:** OC-001
**Stage:** 444 CRITIQUE
**Autonomy level:** L3

**Candidate:** Create CHECKPOINT.md to store session state for recovery, with checkpoint schema, recovery protocol, rollback rules, anti-hallucination rule.
**Verdict:** SEALED
**Approved by:** Arif (888 Judge)

**Reason:** Audit identified rollback discipline score = 0. No checkpoint mechanism exists. Teleportation rule in SOUL.md requires a concrete recovery anchor.

**Constitutional floors checked:** F02 TRUTH (no false continuity claims), F07 HUMILITY (acknowledge statelessness)

**Risk:** Low
**Irreversible:** No
**Rollback possible:** Yes

**Outcome:** CHECKPOINT.md created with schema, recovery protocol, and rollback rules.

**Status:** SEALED

## 2026-05-01 — Archive conflicting per-model agent files

**Decision ID:** DEC-004
**Task ID:** OC-001
**Stage:** 999 SEAL
**Autonomy level:** L3

**Candidate:** Mark CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, ARIF.md as stale — contain instruction sets that may contradict SOUL.md and 000–999 governance.

**Verdict:** SEALED
**Approved by:** Arif (per Phase 10 directive, 888 Judge)

**Reason:** These files contain per-model agent instructions that may override SOUL.md boundaries. Until reconciled against 000–999 loop, they are a governance risk.

**Evidence basis:** Audit identified scattered per-model files as medium risk — no reconciliation with SOUL.md performed.

**Constitutional floors checked:** F02 TRUTH (no conflicting directives), F09 ANTIHANTU (prevents instruction injection via agent files)

**Risk:** Low — archival only, all files backed up with timestamps

**Irreversible:** No — can reactivate by removing stale header

**Rollback possible:** Yes — delete stale headers to restore

**Outcome:** All three files backed up, stale header prepended, marked INACTIVE.

**Status:** SEALED
